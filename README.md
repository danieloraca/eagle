# ðŸš€ 2D Space Simulation in Rust

This is an early prototype of a 2D space simulation project built in Rust using [`macroquad`](https://crates.io/crates/macroquad).

## Features

- âœ… Ship movement with keyboard controls  
- âœ… Dynamic starfield background  
- âœ… Particle system for engine effects  
- âœ… Modular audio integration (via `macroquad::audio`)  
- âœ… ECS-inspired separation of update/render logic  
- âœ… Clean module structure for scalability
